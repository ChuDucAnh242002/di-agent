**Context-Aware Agent for Decentralized Edge Orchestration**

Implementation artifact for the dissertation *A Context-Aware Agentic Framework for Decentralized Edge Computing* (Tampere University, Diyaz Yakubov, supervised by David Hästbacka and Sergio Moreschini). Funded by Business Finland — Industry X and 6GSoft projects.

## What this is

`di-agent` is an orchestration agent for resource-constrained edge nodes (Raspberry Pi 4 and equivalent). Every node runs its own agent, and each agent models only the machine it runs on. Questions about the whole cluster go to peers, not to a central control plane.

The agent reasons against the **Semantic Map**, a live model of one system's state:

- **Properties.** The map holds what the node and each workload on it (a pod, a systemd unit, any producer that names a subject) are doing. A property is admitted when it is first observed, marked stale when it goes silent, and retired when it stays silent. If it is observed again, it comes back.
- **Relationships.** Relationships between properties are learned from paired observations. A freshly started agent reports that it does not know what a relationship is worth yet, instead of reporting a constant nobody measured. The proposer also *discovers* relationships that nobody declared, which an operator then confirms.
- **Answers you can trace.** `GET /state` says what the system is doing right now. `GET /state/estimate` answers "what happens to X if this workload grows, or leaves". Every answer carries a decision id whose inputs can be replayed afterwards.

The code is built on five swappable contracts (Collector, Ontology, Reasoner, Proposer, Tuner) with a compliance suite for each. The shipped profile is `edge-minimal`: a single static Go binary with no runtime dependencies.

## Research context

This repository covers **Publications P6 and P7** of the dissertation:

| Publication | Title | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| P6 | Semantic Map & Context-Aware Agent Architecture | In progress |
| P7 | Decentralized Agentic Framework (P2P coordination) | Planned — Year 3 |

The agent synthesises findings from five prior publications:

| Publication | What it contributes to di-agent |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| P1 — [Performance & Resource Efficiency](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-84617-5_7) | Evidence behind the declared propositions; the workloads the convergence study replays per distribution |
| P2 — [Security, Resilience & Maintainability](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-84617-5_8) | Evidence for the constructs a running cluster cannot move, which is why they stay at selection time. Recovery time constants |
| P3 — [Di-Select](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10586-026-06269-5) (*Cluster Computing*, 2026) | Backbone topology: 7 constructs, 15 causal propositions (P1–P15) |
| P4 — Energy Analysis, DVFS / CPU microarchitecture (ESOCC 2026, to appear) | Why energy is *not* routed: the model is calibrated for one hardware class and no node here measures a joule |
| P5 — Overhead Decomposition, k0s cgroup analysis (ESOCC 2026, to appear) | Per-container evidence that the orchestration tax is real and small; k0s-only |

## Status

**Research prototype, open for testing.** The `edge-minimal` daemon, the state model (subjects, lifecycle, discovery, counterfactual estimates), the `mapctl` CLI, the embedded operator console, peer coordination and the natural-language `/explain` layer are all implemented and covered by CI. The `cloud-full` profile (graph database, RDF/OWL ontology, Bayesian reasoner) is planned and does not exist yet.

There is **no authentication** on any endpoint. Run it on a trusted network only. See [`OPERATING.md`](OPERATING.md#read-this-first).

## Quick start

Go 1.22+ is the only hard requirement.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DiyazY/di-agent && cd di-agent/semantic-map/go
go build ./... && go test ./...     # verify the checkout

./dev.sh demo              # guided tour: build, start, scenarios, operator console
```

**Testing it?** [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md) has a 15-minute walkthrough that works from a fresh clone, what to look at, and how to report what you find.

The parquet replay tool (`./dev.sh replay …`) replays the dissertation's Netdata dataset. That dataset is **not part of this repository**, so replay needs `--data-dir` pointing at a copy of it. Everything else runs without it.
